		<h3>Greetings</h3>
		<p>Welcome to BDTWeb, a portfolio in progress of Bradley Thompson.
		
		<p>Click <a href="files/Bradley Thompson Resume.doc">here</a>
		to download my resume.</p>
		
		<h3>Current project(s)</h3>
		</p>Projects here are not, per se, completed or finished products, but rather
		sandbox projects for educational and experimental purposes. <br>
		These were created using Unity with scripts written in C#.<br>
		To run, download the zip file using the link, extract the files to a folder, and click the .exe file to run. <br>
		Select your resolution, and have fun!</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="files/Jumpity.zip">Revenge on Fufu</a>
				<p>Background art done by Riley Mullins, music written and recorded by myself.<br>
				Use 'a' and 'd' or left and right arrows to move the character (a field mouse) left/right,
				spacebar to jump.<br>
				Double jump is possible. Survive as long as you can while getting the most bops by jumping 
				on the bunnies!</p>
				<p>Click <a href="games/jumpity/jumpity.html" target="_blank">here</a> to play in your browser!</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="files/TanksTD.zip">TanksTD</a>
				<p>Use w-a-s-d to move the tank around while aiming with the mouse. Left click to fire the cannon.<br>
				Destroy zombies, avoid soon to be working enemy turrets. No points or objectives, just have fun! <br>
				Zombie will respawn after three hits from the cannonball. Sorry, no sound on this one yet.<br>
				Run as host to start the game, network play is possible, but not properly playable.</p>
