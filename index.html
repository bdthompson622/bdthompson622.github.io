					You have arrived at BDTWeb. This site is a portfolio/work-in-progress of sorts, developed and
					maintained by yours truly, Bradley Thompson.
					Here, you will find a variety of projects created by me for academic or personal purposes to further
					my skills as an amateur Software and Web Developer.
					My intent is to share these works with potential employers to demonstrate my abilities, and turn
					from amateur to professional. You will also find my current resume here as well.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some of these projects you can view in your browser, such as my Web Designs page, where my web page
					designs are showcased, and on the interactables page, which displays
					what I have learned with Unity. Some are more complete than others, I like to think of them as game
					'sketches' if you will. Other projects are in compressed archives
					and they must be downloaded and extracted to run.
