		<h3>About me</h3>
		<p class="biop"> <img src="images/purpme.jpg" alt="Me being purple." style="float:right; margin-left:50px; margin-right: 50px;">
		Greetings. I am Brad, creator of this site, husbannd, father, and student. Born June 22, 1985 in Little Rock, Arkansas, I graduated 
		Mills University Studies High School in 2003 under the AP program. I am currently a senior persuing a degree in Computer Science 
		at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. However, I am not enrolled this semester so that I may stay home with
		my youngest of three children until he is old enough to enter kindergarten, then I will finish with my degree.</p>
		
		<p class="biop">I work full-time with one of the largest retailers in the world, Walmart, as an eCommerce Associate here in Sherwood, AR. In total, 
		I have about 7 years experience with the company. I also work part-time as a Shift Leader at Firehouse Subs in the Lakewood shopping center, 
		having almost 4 years experience with them. I enjoy working for these companies. Once I complete my degree I can continue working for Walmart
		at their Home Office in Bentonville as a software engineer. I feel as though with my experience with company policy and operations in several departments, 
		I can be a great asset for technology development.</p>
		
		<p class="biop">In my free time I enjoy spending time with my family and making music. As I mentioned before, I am married and have
		three children whom I love dearly. I own several different musical instruments, most lending themselves to rock music (guitars, drums, keyboards.)
		A link to a collection of some of my music can be found on the Links page of this site. All music was recorded in my home studio. Most
		of the production was done in Sony Acid Pro, all of which is originally written and produced by myself. I use Goldwave for recording instruments
		and vocals, which are then imported into Acid Pro.</p<
		
		<p class="biop">In my free time, along with music-ing, I enjoy the video games. I am seeking my computer science degree under the
		GAME option, which along with computer and programming classes I also take drawing and graphic design classes. Ultimately, I want to work
		with a game developing company, or independantly, creating and coding games. However I realize this may not be a practical approach as far as
		making a living goes, but I am not putting all my eggs in one basket so to speak. Once I graduate I am hoping to land a job as a software developer,
		or possibly as a web designer. I feel as though I could work on front-end or back-end on projects with my current skillset. I am learning how to use
		Unity to develop games, as well as this site to practice and experiment with HTML/CSS.</p>
