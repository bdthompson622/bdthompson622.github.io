		<h3>Biography</h3>
		<p class="biop"> <img src="images/brad.jpg" alt="Me being purple." style="float:right; margin-left:50px; margin-right: 50px;">
		Greetings. I am Brad, husband, father, student, and creator of this site. Born June 22, 1985 in Little Rock, Arkansas, I graduated 
		Mills University Studies High School in 2003 under the AP program. I am currently a senior persuing a degree in Computer Science 
		at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock.</p>
		
		<h3>Work Experience</h3>
		<p class="biop">I work full-time with one of the largest retailers in the world, Walmart, as an eCommerce Associate 
		here in Sherwood, AR. In total, I have about 7 years experience with the company. I also work part-time as a Shift Leader 
		at Firehouse Subs in the Lakewood shopping center, having almost 4 years experience with them. Once my degree is complete, 
		I intend to seek a career as a developer, possibly at the Walmart Home Office as a software engineer since I 
		already have experience with the company and company policies, procedures, and requirements. Most of my previous work experience has been with food-service, including Dominos, US Pizza, and 
		Little Caesers, to name a few. I also have experience in construction building footings for residential and commercial 
		properties.
		
		<h3>Education</h3>
		<p class="biop">I am seeking my computer science degree under the
		GAME option, which along with computer and programming classes I also take drawing and graphic design classes. Ultimately, I want to work
		with a game developing company, or independantly, creating and coding games. However I realize this may not be a practical approach as far as
		making a living goes, but I am not putting all my eggs in one basket so to speak. Once I graduate I am hoping to land a job as a software developer,
		or possibly as a web designer. I feel as though I could work on front-end or back-end on projects with my current skillset. I am learning how to use
		Unity to develop games, as well as this site to practice and experiment with HTML/CSS.</p>
