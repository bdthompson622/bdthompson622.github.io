		<h3>About me</h3>
		<div>
		<p class="biop"> <img src="images/purpme.jpg" alt="Me being purple." style="float:right; margin-left:50px; margin-right: 50px;">I am an Earthling that has survived 34 revolutions around the sun. I am happily married with 3 wonderful children.
		I work for one of the largest retailers on the planet, Walmart. I can be seen dispensing online grocery orders at your
		friendly local Sherwood Supercenter. I also make superbaful sandwiches at the House of Fire submarines.
		During my free time, I enjoy making suitable vibrations in several different forms. I currently own an electric guitar,
		as well as an acoustic one, a bass guitar, several keyboards, and a digital drum set. A link to my music site can 
		be found in the Links section of this site.</p>
		
		</div>
		<p class="biop">In my free time, along with music-ing, I enjoy the video games very very much.</p>
		<h3>Game Systems I own:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>XBox One</li>
			<li>2 x XBox360</li>
			<li>Nintendo Switch</li>
			<li>PS4</li>
			<li>PS2</li>
			<li>Retron (for NES cartridges)</li>
			<li>Alienware PC, among others (and a couple laptops)</li>
			<li>and also my iPhone, for the gaming-on-the-go</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="biop">
		Currently I am working through Final Fantasy XII on the PS2, but there are several games in my backlog.
